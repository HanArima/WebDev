# WebDevelopment
#### This contains all the projects I practice while learning Web Development from FreeCodeCamp. Basically, all their small projects in the "Responsive Web Design" course just me practicing them again from the scratch.

### Project 1: Registration Form
This is a very simple implementation of making a form and adding elements such as radio button, checkbox, dropdown-menus, textbox, text inputs etc. This was a ready-made template so not much to create.


### Project 2: Survey Form
This was created from scratch without any template, just a reference site. I learnt things likr how to change color of the placeholder text, how to contrast colors with background using an online color coder that gives me the color code of the pixel i touch on my background, how class doesn't actually gather the elements and become one but it is actually a way to optimize code and minimize redundancy.
Overall, I had a lot of fun while making it. And BTW I got 9000 power points from FreeCodeCamp on this project. ;)

### Project 3: Quiz
I tried a new footer style. I learned how to make colorful hovers, how I can't crop footer video background using just html and css, how PHP is bit pain in the head since all the files must be hosted in "htdocs". My SQLserver were also not connecting at first. It worked only after I tinkered with my config.inc file. In the end I dropped the backend plan. 
I will make this responsive once I learn a bit more about it.
